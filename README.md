PROJECT PROPOSAL


Problem Statement

Topic - A study of the trends of shooting incidents that occurred in the state of New York, in order to take certain measures to put a stop to such crimes.

The shooting incidents are gradually increasing. They can be brought under control only after studying the trends of their occurrence. Security measures can be increased in the most vulnerable locations at the riskiest hours of the day in the streets of New York. There are certain categories of people that are involved in such crimes and with the help of this study they can be targeted and educated such that they do not get involved in world of crime and reside in the country as responsible citizens.

Dataset
 
This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included.

5. PRECINCT – The Precinct id number where the crime was reported.
6. JURISDICTION_CODE – The code of the jurisdiction
7. LOCATION_DESC – The description of exact location of the crime.

Algorithms and Methods

My analysis will be conducted majorly with the use of the programming languages such as Python, R and tools such as Tableau, in order to obtain the required deliverables.
 
Risks

1. There are certain values that are missing in the database. I plan to handle this issue by inserting mean values in their place.

2. Data Type Conversion is an issue which might occur. I’ll make use of python in order to assign required data types.
 
Deliverables

The below deliverables will be obtained after the completion of the project. 
 
1. The most unsafe Boroughs of the New York City.
2. Average age group of the offenders.
3. Sex of the perps involved in such a crime.
4. The race which commits this crime most often.
5. Average age group of the victims of such incidents.
6. Sex of the victims being targeted the most.
7. Incidents which resulted in death of the victims.
8. The category of location where such crimes occur the most.
9. The prime hours of the occurrence of such crimes.
